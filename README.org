* Setup the app

Just run ~docker-compose up~.


* Design decisions

** Data
For consistency reasons since =Node.js= was an imposed choice for the back-end, and to not impose to my reviewer to install another language, I would have chosen to load the data in =Javascript=. But since I was allowed to use Docker this was not a problem anymore. So since time was limited, I choose Python to get the data in the database as it was the language I was more confident with.

** Database
Since the =MySQL= official Docker image was more than 100MB, I thought it was overkill for a simple application like this one, so I eliminated =MySQL=. I surprisingly found an =alpine-postgres= which was only 30MB, so I hesitated between =PostgreSQL= and =SQLite=.

** Front-end
Since I have a really small experience with front-end frameworks, and since time was limited, I choose the one I read it had the more gentle learning curve, e.g. =Vue.js=. Without the time limiting constraint, I would have chosen React.
