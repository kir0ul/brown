* Design decisions

** Data
For consistency reasons since /Node.js/ was an imposed choice for the back-end, and to not impose to my reviewer to install another language, I would have chosen to load the data in /Javascript/. But since I was allowed to use Docker this was not a problem anymore. So since time was limited, I choose Python to get the data in the database as it was the language I was more confident with.

The /MySQL/ official Docker image was more than 100MB, I thought it was overkill for a simple application like this one, so I eliminated /MySQL/. I surprisingly found a lean /alpine/ version of /PostgreSQL/ which was less than 30MB, so I hesitated between /PostgreSQL/ and /SQLite/. At the end I chose to go with /PostgreSQL/ because it was simpler to use with Docker. Without Docker I would have chosen to go with /SQLite/. I also chose to go with the /SQLAlchemy/ ORM in case I had some problem down the road so that it would be easy to switch to another database in case (and also because I wanted to learn it).

When the app is running, you can inspect the database with the /Adminer/ web client running in a container using the following URL: http://localhost:8081/?pgsql=db&username=postgres&db=postgres&ns=public

** Back-end
The assignment asked for a single page application, the back-end only being there to make the queries to the database, so I believe a simple /Node.js/ API with the following three routes should do the work:
- one route to get the list of the articles,
- one route to search by author last name,
- one route to get the data for the visualization.
I used the /Sequelize/ ORM to query the database.

** Front-end
Since I have a really small experience with front-end frameworks, and since time was limited, I choose the one I read it had the more gentle learning curve, e.g. /Vue.js/. Without the time limiting constraint, I would probably have chosen /React/ which has the biggest community today. I also used the /Vuetify/ plugin to gain some time with already tuned components with nice CSS.

For the visualization, I chose to use the /Britecharts/ library, which is built on top of /D3.js/, and which should require less time to learn how to use. Without the time limiting constraint, I would probably have chosen to go directly with /D3.js/.


* Setup the app

Just run ~docker-compose up~ and open your browser at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/
